    chapter1: {
    story: `The plane descended through thick clouds over Amsterdam, and I pressed my face against the small window, watching the Netherlands spread out below me like a patchwork quilt of green fields and neat canals. July 13, 2023. I was twenty-three years old, carrying two suitcases and dreams bigger than the island I'd left behind in Curaçao.
    
    Software Development at Alfa College in Groningen. The words still felt foreign on my tongue, but they represented everything I'd worked toward. A chance to build something. To become someone. To prove that a kid from the Caribbean could make it in the tech world. 
    
    The train from Amsterdam to Groningen took me through landscapes I'd only seen in pictures windmills that actually turned, fields so flat they seemed to stretch into infinity, cities with names I couldn't pronounce. Everything was green in a way that Curaçao never was. Green and orderly and impossibly clean.

    My cousin Marcus had offered to let me stay with him while I got settled. We'd exchanged a few messages over WhatsApp, and he seemed friendly enough. Family helping family—that's how it was supposed to work, right? I had his address written on a piece of paper that was already soft from being handled too much during the journey. 

    The house in Groningen was smaller than I'd expected, squeezed between identical brick buildings on a narrow street. I rang the doorbell at exactly 6:30 PM, my suitcases heavy in the evening drizzle that seemed to be the Netherlands' way of welcoming me. 

    Marcus opened the door with a smile that didn't quite reach his eyes. He was older than me by several years, already settled into Dutch life with his neat apartment and careful way of speaking Dutch mixed with English mixed with Papiamentu when he remembered I was family. 

"Dinesh! You made it," he said, but he was already looking past me at my luggage. "Come in, come in. You must be tired." 

The apartment was cramped but clean. Too clean, maybe. Everything had its place, and I could tell immediately that my presence was going to disrupt that careful order. Marcus showed me to a small room—more of a storage closet, really—where I could sleep on an air mattress. 

"It's temporary," he said, and I nodded gratefully. Everything felt temporary. My student visa, my dreams, my place in this strange flat country where people rode bicycles in the rain like it was nothing. 

For two weeks, I tried to make myself invisible. I woke up early, went to the college to handle enrollment paperwork, explored Groningen's winding streets and endless bicycle paths. I bought groceries and cooked simple meals, always asking if it was okay to use the kitchen, always cleaning up immediately after. 

But I could feel the tension building. Marcus would watch me eat, a calculation happening behind his eyes. He'd make comments about utility bills, about how expensive everything was in the Netherlands. I offered to pay more, but he'd wave it away with that same smile that never warmed. 

The soup incident happened on a Thursday evening. I'd been at college all day, dealing with more paperwork, trying to understand the Dutch bureaucracy that seemed designed to confuse international students. I came home exhausted and hungry, and there in the refrigerator was a large pot of soup. It had been sitting there for two days—I'd seen it when I put away groceries, seen it again that morning when I grabbed milk for my coffee. 

It was vegetable soup, homemade, and it smelled incredible. In Curaçao, family food was shared food. If someone cooked, everyone ate. I heated up a bowl, savoring the warmth and the taste of something that reminded me of home, even though the vegetables were different. 

Marcus came home an hour later and went straight to the kitchen. I heard the refrigerator door open, heard him moving things around, heard the silence that stretched too long. 

"Dinesh." His voice was different now. Cold. "Did you eat my soup?" 

I looked up from my laptop where I'd been trying to figure out the Dutch healthcare system. "The soup in the fridge? Yes, I—" 

"That was my soup." He was standing in the doorway now, arms crossed. "I made that for my lunches this week." 

"I'm sorry, I didn't know. I can replace it, or I can cook—" 

"You're old enough to know better." The words hit me like a slap. "Dutch people only eat once a day. You can't just take other people's food." 

The lie was so obvious it took my breath away. I'd seen him eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day I'd been there. I'd watched Dutch people in cafés and restaurants eating multiple meals. But I was twenty-three, in a foreign country, dependent on his kindness, and the power dynamic was crystal clear. 

"I understand," I said quietly. "I'm sorry." 

But sorry wasn't enough. The atmosphere in the apartment changed immediately. Where there had been polite tolerance, now there was active hostility. Marcus started making pointed comments about bills, about space, about how difficult it was to have a houseguest. The smile disappeared entirely. 

Three days later, on a Sunday evening when the rain was coming down in sheets, he asked for his key back. 

"I think it's time you find your own place," he said, not meeting my eyes. "This arrangement isn't working out." 

"But where will I go?" The question came out smaller than I intended. "It's raining, and it's Sunday night—" 

"You're a grown man. You'll figure it out." 

I packed my two suitcases in the cramped room while the rain drummed against the window. Everything I owned in the Netherlands fit into those bags, plus my laptop bag with my acceptance letters and bank statements and all the paperwork that proved I belonged here, even if it didn't feel that way. 

Marcus stood by the door while I gathered my things, checking his phone, avoiding eye contact. When I was ready, he opened the door to the rain and the dark street beyond. 

"Good luck," he said, but his tone suggested he didn't mean it. 

I stood on the sidewalk for a moment, rain soaking through my jacket, suitcases getting heavy in my hands. Other windows glowed warm and yellow in the darkness, full of people who had places to belong. I pulled out my phone and scrolled through my contacts, looking for options. 

That's when I found the message I'd been avoiding. My other cousin—Marcus's cousin too—had offered me a place to stay if I ever needed it. She lived further out, in Zuidbroek, but she had space and she understood what it was like to be family trying to make it in the Netherlands. 

Her name was Rosanna, and when I called her that night from a 24-hour café where I'd taken shelter, she sounded genuinely concerned. 

"Of course you can stay with us," she said. "Family takes care of family. Tjeerd and I have room, and the kids would love to meet their cousin from Curaçao." 

I took the last train out to Zuidbroek that night, my suitcases dripping on the train floor, watching my reflection in the dark window as the city lights gave way to smaller towns and finally to countryside. I had no way of knowing that I was traveling toward something that would make Marcus's coldness look like kindness. 

No way of knowing that the woman who sounded so caring on the phone would spend the next year and a half systematically breaking me down, piece by piece, until I barely recognized myself. 

All I knew was that I was twenty-three years old, alone in a foreign country, and I needed somewhere to belong. Even if that somewhere would nearly destroy me. 

The train pulled into Zuidbroek station at 11:47 PM, and Rosanna was waiting for me in the parking lot, smiling and waving like I was a long-lost son coming home. 

I walked toward her with my suitcases and my hope, not knowing I was walking into a trap.

chapter2: {
    story: `The first few days at Rosanna and Tjeerd’s felt like walking into a house with invisible walls I couldn’t see, but every movement I made seemed to hit one. At first, I told myself it was just their way of keeping order, of being strict but fair. But the rules started piling up faster than I could adjust. 

No studying on weekends. No gaming. No earbuds while I tried to focus. “You need to spend time with the family,” Rosanna said, her voice carrying that tone that made it sound like she was giving advice, when really it was an order. I was twenty-three, almost twenty-four, but suddenly I had to behave like their nineteen-year-old son, Isaac. 

The meals were small, measured, almost ritualistic. I was given my portion, and anything more was considered greed. If I touched food outside my portion, I was scolded. If I stayed in my room too long, it was suspicious. Every hour of my day felt monitored—not physically, but mentally. I could feel it in every glance, every comment. 

Chores became a constant. Washing dishes, tidying the living room, scrubbing floors I didn’t want to touch. Even when the house looked clean, Rosanna found something wrong. I tried asking for clarification, for some structure or schedule, but her answers were vague: “Just do it right,” she would say, as if I should somehow know the invisible standard. 

The strangest part was the quiet control. It wasn’t yelling or hitting—it was in the restrictions, the micro-managing of my movements. Every choice, every little comfort I wanted, had to pass through a filter I couldn’t see. I started counting moments of freedom like treasures: the ten minutes I could spend reading without being interrupted, the brief walk outside to feel the air on my face. 

Even the simplest tasks became traps. Making tea was scrutinized: the cup had to be placed exactly right, the teabag removed at the right moment, the sugar measured in a way that seemed arbitrary but was somehow wrong if I misstepped. I began timing everything, calculating how long I could spend in a room before someone appeared with a correction or a glare. 

Sleep wasn’t safe either. At night, I could hear Rosanna moving through the house, doors opening and closing, her presence reminding me that I was never truly alone. I began leaving the hall light on, pretending to read until exhaustion took me, just to avoid being called out for being “lazy” or “asleep too early.” 

And yet, I told myself it was temporary. I reminded myself that I had a goal—to finish my studies, to survive the year. But every day, the rules grew heavier, and the house felt smaller. I had arrived in the Netherlands full of hope, but already, the first cracks were appearing in the foundation of that dream. 

The worst part wasn’t just the restrictions—it was the constant questioning of my own judgment. Did I deserve these rules? Was I being unreasonable? I couldn’t separate their control from my own mistakes. And slowly, I began to realize: this wasn’t just about rules. It was about control. 

The tension in the house was unspoken but palpable. Rosanna’s eyes would follow me from the kitchen to the living room. Tjeerd would make offhand comments about my “attitude” or “laziness,” and I would flinch, heart racing. Even Isaac, who was barely an adult himself, became an unwitting monitor, reporting my minor missteps in a casual way that made me feel like I was constantly under review. 

By the end of the first week, I felt like I was walking on thin ice, fragile and careful, afraid that one wrong step would shatter everything. I was no longer just a student trying to learn software development; I was a guest in a house where my every move could be scrutinized and punished. 

And yet, in those quiet moments—when I was alone in my room, staring at my laptop or sketching code in a notebook—I clung to a fragile hope. I reminded myself that I had chosen this path. I had left Curaçao for a reason, and I wasn’t going to let these invisible walls define me. But I could already feel the toll it was taking, the way my body tensed constantly, the way my stomach knotted every time someone spoke my name. 

And I knew, deep down, that the rules were only the beginning. `,

  chapter3: {
    story: `October arrived quietly, but with it came the first unmistakable signs that the life I had imagined in the Netherlands was slipping through my fingers. I had expected challenges when I moved here—adjusting to a new culture, navigating student life, managing my finances—but nothing had prepared me for this: being denied the most basic human need. Food. 

It started with small comments. Rosanna would remark on my portions, whispering in passing about how I “ate too much” or “took more than my share.” At first, I tried to laugh it off. Surely she was joking. But the laughter faded as the days passed and the comments became rules. I was told I could only eat certain foods at certain times, and anything beyond that was forbidden. Breakfast, lunch, dinner—they were rationed not by need, but by her whim. 

I began to plan my days around these small windows of food. I memorized the schedule of the household kitchen, noting when I could quietly grab a slice of bread or a piece of fruit. But even that was dangerous. One wrong move, one glance in the “wrong” direction, and I would be reminded, sharply and publicly, that I was overstepping. 

By mid-October, the restrictions had grown stricter. Meals were no longer offered freely; I had to ask, and asking felt like begging. There were days I went hungry entirely, scraping together crumbs from the edges of bread loaves or sipping tepid water just to stave off the gnawing emptiness in my stomach. My body began to feel heavier in some ways, weaker in others. Fatigue became constant, and even walking to class felt like dragging a weight behind me. 

At night, my stomach would ache. I would lie in bed, counting the hours until I could eat again—or until I could pretend I had eaten enough to survive. I was twenty-three, living in what was supposed to be a safe, nurturing environment, and yet I felt the hollow pit of hunger gnawing at more than my body—it gnawed at my sense of dignity, my sense of self. 

Hand-washing my clothes became another ritual of quiet desperation. With laundry machines limited and Rosanna controlling when I could even enter the laundry room, I spent hours scrubbing shirts, socks, and undergarments by hand in the sink. The water would turn grey and foamy, my hands raw and chapped from the soap, and I would rinse and repeat, knowing that one slip could result in a scolding or worse. It was exhausting, repetitive work that seemed to serve no purpose other than keeping me busy, under control, and reminded of my position in the house hierarchy. 

The psychological impact was relentless. I started talking less, smiling less, and questioning everything I did. Was I eating too much or too little? Was I doing chores correctly? Was I imagining the rules, or were they truly as rigid as they seemed? Anxiety became a constant companion. I learned to mask it in public spaces, to act as if everything was fine in class and with my friends, but the moment I returned home, the fear, the tension, the hollow ache returned. 

There were moments of small victories, fleeting but crucial. A friend who sent a care package of snacks from Curaçao. A classmate who noticed my gaunt appearance and asked if I was okay. Those small acts of kindness reminded me that the world outside the house still existed, that survival was possible, and that I wasn’t completely alone. 

But the hunger wasn’t just physical. It was symbolic. It was a daily, visceral reminder of the control Rosanna and Tjeerd had over me. Every denied meal, every forced restriction, every look of disapproval was a lesson: you do not belong here. You are not trusted. You are not free. 

And yet, I held onto hope. I clung to the idea that I could endure this, that I could maintain my studies, that I could finish my program and escape this environment. I documented every detail quietly, sending myself notes, keeping mental records, even if no one else knew. Writing became a lifeline, a way to assert my identity when the rules tried to erase it. 

By the end of October, I realized that my life had been reduced to survival: eat what I was allowed, wash what I could, move carefully, speak only when necessary. I was existing, not living. And yet, in that existence, I began to understand a vital truth: documenting, observing, and preserving my own story was the first act of resistance I could claim. Hunger could control my body, but it could not yet control my mind entirely. 

And so, with each aching step, with each hand-washed shirt, with each forbidden crumb swallowed in secret, I learned the rhythms of the household, the rules that bound me, and the small but essential ways to preserve my own dignity amidst the relentless deprivation. `,

  chapter4: {
    story: `Money, I quickly realized, was another weapon in the arsenal of control. By now, I had learned that food, chores, and personal freedoms were not negotiable—they were tools to remind me of my position in the household. But money—money carried its own rules, its own threats, its own invisible chains. 

It started subtly, the first time Rosanna demanded I contribute to something I hadn’t agreed to. “It’s just €250,” she said, “for the drinks tonight. Everyone’s chipping in.” I blinked, confused. I didn’t drink. I didn’t want to drink. But there it was: an ultimatum disguised as a request. Pay, or be pressured into doing something I didn’t want. 

I hesitated, trying to reason. “I don’t have that kind of money right now,” I told her. Her eyes narrowed. Tjeerd’s voice joined in, calm but heavy: “You’ll find a way. That’s what adults do.” The implication was clear—my compliance wasn’t optional. I paid the €250, a sum that would have covered groceries for weeks for me, and yet, the real cost was the erosion of my autonomy. 

Then came the loans. DUO, the Dutch student finance system, was supposed to help me. I was advised to take certain loans, with the promise that they were manageable. But the advice given to me was laced with deception—or at the very least, negligence. The loans piled up faster than I could track, and I soon discovered that I had been led into debt far beyond what I had anticipated. 

Every month became a negotiation with survival. I worked part-time jobs, calculating how much I could earn versus how much I needed to hand over to repay debts that were not entirely my fault. Each paycheck disappeared almost immediately into bills, loans, and coerced payments to the household. I started living paycheck to paycheck, every day a reminder that money, like food, was a constant battleground. 

Borrowed money became another tool of manipulation. I lent small sums to family members or friends, expecting repayment. But in Rosanna’s home, money seemed fluid only in one direction—toward the household, away from me. I asked for repayment, and my requests were met with excuses, deflections, or outright denial. “We’ll talk about it later,” became a mantra I would hear too often. And later never came. 

The psychological toll was heavy. Every interaction with money carried fear. Could I afford this? Would I be punished for not contributing enough? Was my financial literacy being questioned simply because they could? I began second-guessing every financial decision, no matter how small. Even spending €2 on a snack felt like stepping into a minefield. 

I realized that financial abuse wasn’t just about taking money—it was about creating dependency. By controlling what I could spend, what I could borrow, what I could earn, they had me in a perpetual state of need, always reliant on their rules, always at risk of punishment or disapproval. Money became a tool to shape my behavior, to enforce obedience, to remind me of my vulnerability. 

Even when I tried to plan ahead, to save a small amount for emergencies or personal freedom, I was met with resistance. Comments about being “wasteful,” or “not thinking ahead,” or being “irresponsible” drilled into me the idea that financial autonomy was dangerous. I was never allowed to truly manage my own money. I was taught, in subtle but relentless ways, that I could not be trusted with my own resources. 

By the time winter approached, I had learned to navigate the invisible minefield of household finances. I had memorized deadlines, rationed my spending, and worked harder than ever just to survive. But I also began documenting everything: every demand, every unexpected charge, every misadvised loan. I wrote it down quietly, a silent ledger of abuse. One day, I realized, these records would be more than numbers—they would be evidence, proof that my autonomy had been systematically undermined, and that survival required more than just endurance; it required clarity, precision, and memory. 

Financial manipulation had become a cage, but it was a cage I was learning to map. I understood, slowly but clearly, that my ability to survive would depend not only on what I earned or saved, but on how I documented, calculated, and resisted the pressures imposed by those who sought to control every aspect of my life. Money, I realized, was never just money. It was a test of my resilience, and I could not fail. `,

  chapter5: {
    story: `By the time November rolled around, the patterns of control were no longer subtle—they were the air I breathed. I could feel it in every corner of the house, in every glance and word exchanged, in every restriction that seemed to tighten around me like a noose. I realized that the hunger, the financial manipulation, and the endless chores were only parts of a larger design: total isolation. 

The car incident was the first tangible example. My vehicle, which I had rarely used, became a tool for criticism. One morning, Rosanna walked past, her eyes scanning the street. “Look at this! You’ve dented the door again!” she exclaimed. My stomach dropped. I knew I hadn’t touched it in weeks. I protested, explaining the dents were old, unavoidable, trivial. But my explanation fell on deaf ears. Her voice hardened. Tjeerd nodded silently beside her, an unspoken reinforcement. The accusation lingered like a stain, a reminder that even my property was not safe, that even the outside world could be policed from within these walls. 

Household chores had grown into a full-time occupation. Floors needed scrubbing, dishes needed constant washing, laundry had to be timed precisely, and every surface required inspection. No matter how meticulously I performed, there was always a critique waiting. I was trapped in a cycle: complete a task, endure scrutiny, feel small, repeat. My time to study, to relax, to breathe freely, was shrinking with each passing day. 

And then came the social isolation. Friends from college called, but I could rarely answer. Social gatherings were off-limits, because Rosanna claimed I “needed to focus on the family” or “you should be home helping.” Gaming, which had been my escape, was forbidden. Earbuds, the small comfort that let me immerse myself in music or lectures, were taken as evidence of rebellion. My world contracted. Conversations with classmates became superficial. Laughter felt distant, almost foreign. The more I obeyed, the smaller my personal universe became. 

Even the internet, my usual lifeline to the outside world, was surveilled. I learned to type quickly, to hide tabs, to close windows instantly when someone approached. A moment of curiosity—a search for student aid, a message to a friend—could be met with suspicion, criticism, or punishment. Slowly, I began to internalize the restrictions, policing myself before they even noticed. 

The psychological weight was suffocating. I questioned every decision. Should I leave my room for a few minutes or stay inside? Should I eat the portion allotted, or leave some in case it was considered “too much”? Should I speak up or stay silent? Every choice carried consequences, and the consequences were unpredictable. 

I also noticed how they manipulated emotions to maintain control. Praise was rare, given only to reinforce compliance. Criticism was constant, designed to instill self-doubt. When I asked for help or clarification, I was met with vague answers, sighs, or silent judgment. Over time, I began to anticipate disapproval, shaping my behavior not for freedom, but for safety. 

Even small victories were tinged with fear. I learned to find moments of respite—early mornings when the house was quiet, brief walks outside, the few messages I could exchange with friends. But these were fragile islands in a sea of control. I could not fully relax, not even for a minute, because the environment itself demanded vigilance. 

By the end of the month, I realized that my isolation was almost total. Emotional, social, and even physical freedoms were restricted. I was allowed to exist, but only within boundaries carefully drawn by others. I began documenting everything more meticulously—each chore, each accusation, each denied request—because I knew that surviving this house required more than endurance. It required awareness, memory, and proof. 

I began to understand a painful truth: control works most effectively when you internalize it. When I followed rules before they were enforced, when I questioned myself constantly, when I doubted my own judgment—I had become complicit in my own confinement. Recognizing this was bitter, but necessary. It was the first step toward resisting, toward reclaiming autonomy that was being systematically stripped away. 

Isolation and control were no longer just household rules—they had become a way of life. And yet, even in that oppressive environment, I held onto one fragile certainty: documenting, remembering, and observing every detail was my first act of rebellion. The house could control my movements, my meals, my chores—but it could not yet take my mind. 

And I clung to that thought, quietly, as I planned my next moves in silence, knowing that endurance alone would not be enough. `,

  chapter6: {
    story: `February arrived like a warning bell I couldn’t ignore. The months of hunger, isolation, and financial manipulation had worn me down, but I had clung to the hope that things might stabilize. I was wrong. That hope shattered the day Rosanna demanded €100 in rent. 

“Why should I pay to suffer?” I asked, my voice shaking but loud enough to pierce the usual veil of silence I had maintained. My words hung in the air, heavier than the money itself. I wasn’t refusing out of stubbornness; I simply couldn’t reconcile paying for the right to be trapped, for the right to endure restrictions and abuse. 

Her answer was sharp, practiced: “It’s simple. You live here, you pay. Everyone contributes. No exceptions.” Tjeerd stood silently, nodding, the unspoken weight of compliance pressing down on me. I realized then that money, once again, was not just about finance—it was about control. They wanted me financially tethered, dependent, and fearful. 

By May 20, 2025, things escalated beyond words and numbers. I returned home one afternoon to find the doors locked. I rang the bell, knocked on windows, my heart pounding in my chest. When Tjeerd finally appeared, he looked at me with cold indifference. “You shouldn’t be here right now,” he said, turning away without explanation. I was standing outside in the fading light, a sense of betrayal and helplessness consuming me. 

The following days blurred into anxious waiting. On May 23, I was confronted with a chilling ultimatum: I had until Monday to leave. Every thought raced. Where would I go? How could I survive? How had it come to this, after months of enduring, documenting, and silently hoping for mercy? The house that had been my refuge from homelessness, after the soup incident months earlier, had become a prison. 

Packing my belongings felt surreal. Each suitcase held more than clothes—it held fragments of a life that had been systematically constrained. My textbooks, notebooks, and personal items were tinged with the memory of meals skipped, chores endured, and freedoms denied. I realized that in leaving, I wasn’t just walking out of a house; I was stepping out of the environment that had defined my survival for months. 

Despite the fear, there was clarity. I understood now that endurance alone could not secure my safety or dignity. I had to act, to reclaim space in the world that was mine by right. And yet, fear lingered in every corner of my mind. Leaving meant uncertainty. It meant the unknown. But staying meant continued control, continued hunger, continued abuse. 

That weekend, I slept little. I went over every plan, every possible contact, every lead that could offer temporary refuge. My mental exhaustion was overwhelming, but my resolve was growing. For the first time in months, I felt a flicker of agency. I may have been trapped by circumstances, but I still had choices. I still had documentation, records of every demand, every restriction, every abuse endured. And I began to see that these records were not just proof—they were a lifeline, a way to assert my existence beyond the walls that sought to contain me. 

By Monday, I was ready to leave, suitcase in hand, heart heavy but resolute. Walking out of that house felt like shedding a layer of fear I had worn for far too long. The doors closed behind me, not as a punishment, but as a release. In that moment, I realized that the final straw was not just the ultimatum or the lockout—it was the culmination of months of control, restriction, and denial. And leaving, for the first time in nearly two years, was a reclamation of self. 

Even as I stepped into the unknown, I carried with me a quiet determination: to survive, to document, to speak. The rules, the hunger, the financial manipulation—they had defined the months I had endured, but they would not define the rest of my life. 

And in that realization, I felt the first true breath of freedom I had taken in far too long. `,

  chapter7: {
    story: `August 31, 2024. I remember the date because it was the day I took the first step in admitting to the world—and to myself—that I could not handle this situation alone. I drafted an email to WerkPro, detailing everything: the rules, the hunger, the financial manipulation, the isolation. I wrote carefully, trying to be precise, factual, and unemotional, even though my heart was pounding and my hands shook. 

That first email felt like both an act of courage and an act of desperation. I wasn’t sure anyone would respond. I wasn’t sure anyone would believe me. But writing it, hitting send, was a small rebellion—a declaration that my suffering was real, and that I was not invisible. 

Over the next nine months, I reached out to every organization I could think of: Wender, Leger des Heils, Open Hof, La Hacienda, VNN, Elker, the Gemeente Groningen, Sociaal Team West-Midden Groningen, Kwartier Zorgen Welzijn, Ad Hoc, even Alfa College representatives. Each email, each call, was carefully recorded. I began keeping a log—names, dates, times, responses, and the often disheartening lack of action. 

Some responses offered help. A few social workers replied with practical advice, phone numbers, and suggestions for temporary shelter. A small sense of relief would wash over me, like a brief crack in the weight of the world pressing down on my shoulders. But other responses were frustrating, dismissive, or bureaucratic. “We’ll get back to you in a few weeks,” became a repeated refrain that only heightened my anxiety. 

I realized early on that documentation was not just about seeking help—it was about protecting myself. Each email, each phone call, each note about a denied request or restrictive rule became evidence. If the situation escalated, I would have a paper trail. I would be able to prove what had happened, and more importantly, I would be able to preserve the truth of my experience. 

The emotional toll of this process was immense. Each email I wrote forced me to relive the moments I was trying so hard to survive. Writing about the food restrictions made my stomach churn again. Documenting the financial ultimatums made me feel the tight, anxious knot in my chest that had been there for months. Each detail was a memory of humiliation, of powerlessness, and yet I persisted. 

There were nights I would cry in silence, staring at the blank screen, wondering if anyone would truly understand. I questioned myself constantly: Am I exaggerating? Am I being dramatic? But every recollection, every tiny fact I logged, reminded me that this was real. I was not imagining the abuse. I was not overreacting. I was surviving. 

My classmates became a distant support network. Some knew a little, some nothing at all. I could not burden them with the full truth, fearing judgment or misunderstanding. Instead, I relied on the emails, the forms, and the carefully kept notes. My personal journal became my confidant. I described, day by day, what was happening: the denied meals, the chores, the restrictions, the psychological manipulation. In these pages, I allowed myself to be raw, unfiltered, honest. 

The act of documenting was cathartic, but it was also draining. It demanded energy I did not always have. Sometimes, I would stop mid-sentence, exhausted by the weight of my own experience. But I could not stop. To stop would be to allow the abuse to erase me. And I refused that. 

By the time May 2025 approached, my paper trail had grown into a web of evidence. Emails stacked upon emails, call logs, notes, dates, and times—all a record of the life I had endured. It was overwhelming, but it was also empowering. Every documented moment was a reminder that I had existed, that I had resisted, even in the smallest ways. 

Crying out, formally and systematically, became a declaration: I was no longer silent. I would not allow my suffering to be ignored, dismissed, or forgotten. Through this paper trail, I reclaimed some control over my story, my truth, and my life. 

Even as the final days with Rosanna and Tjeerd approached, I carried this log with me—not physically, but mentally, as a shield and a weapon. I knew that survival alone was not enough. I had to assert my truth. I had to document, to remember, and ultimately, to speak. 

And for the first time in months, I felt a fragile but undeniable sense of hope. Hope that the world could see what I had endured. Hope that, one day, my story could help someone else trapped in silence. Hope that by writing, by documenting, I was taking back a part of myself that had almost been lost. `,

  chapter8: {
    story: `By late May 2025, the weight of everything pressed on me like a storm that had been gathering for months. The hunger, the chores, the financial ultimatums, the isolation, and the constant psychological manipulation—all of it had built into a pressure that I could no longer ignore. I was exhausted, physically, mentally, emotionally. My resilience, which had carried me this far, began to fracture. 

The lockout, the €100 rent demand, and the ultimatum to leave by Monday were only the final sparks that ignited the fire I had been containing. For months, I had endured, rationalized, and suppressed my emotions, telling myself I could survive, that I could make it through. But survival without dignity is not truly living. And I was no longer willing to pretend that enduring abuse was acceptable. 

The emotional collapse came quietly at first. I remember sitting on the edge of my bed, staring at the floor, and feeling a wave of despair wash over me. I had been so focused on the logistics of survival—finding food, completing chores, earning money, documenting evidence—that I hadn’t allowed myself to fully process the trauma. And now, it hit me all at once. 

Tears I had held back for months came freely. Anger, frustration, fear, and grief collided inside me. I screamed in silence, the walls of the room absorbing my pain, offering no comfort. The reality of the abuse I had endured became undeniable. I saw, with stark clarity, how much control Rosanna and Tjeerd had held over me—not just over my body or my time, but over my mind, my choices, and even my sense of self. 

But in that collapse, something shifted. Among the despair, a spark of resolve emerged. I realized that silence had been the enemy all along. By keeping everything inside, by pretending the situation was manageable, I had allowed the abuse to define my reality. Now, acknowledging the pain, documenting it, and preparing to speak out became acts of power. 

I spent hours reviewing my emails, notes, and journals. I read every entry, every documented incident, every carefully recorded date. And for the first time, I felt a sense of clarity. This wasn’t just about survival anymore—it was about reclaiming my life, asserting my truth, and refusing to be erased. 

The decision to speak out was not easy. Fear lingered—fear of judgment, of disbelief, of retaliation. But I knew that keeping silent would be a betrayal of everything I had endured. I had to transform my suffering into testimony, my pain into evidence, my endurance into a story that could not be ignored. 

I began planning, step by step, how I would move forward. I would leave the household, reclaim my space, and continue to document everything. I would reach out to allies and organizations who could provide support. I would not allow shame or fear to dictate my actions. And most importantly, I would write—not just for myself, but for anyone else trapped in silence, anyone else denied the right to be seen and heard. 

The breaking point was devastating, but it was also transformative. I realized that trauma, while consuming, can also illuminate resilience. The act of acknowledging the abuse, of naming it, of documenting it, became a form of resistance. It reminded me that I still had agency, still had choices, and still had a future worth claiming. 

For the first time in months, I felt a fragile sense of hope. Not because the situation had changed overnight, but because I had. I had acknowledged the truth, accepted my vulnerability, and decided that my story mattered. And in that decision, I found the first true measure of freedom I had experienced in far too long. 

The breaking point was painful. But it was necessary. It marked the moment when endurance alone ended, and intentional action began. And for the first time, I understood that survival was not enough—I had to live, and that living meant reclaiming every part of myself that had been suppressed, controlled, or denied. `,

  chapter9: {
    story: `The days following my departure from Rosanna and Tjeerd’s house were some of the most uncertain I had ever faced. I had left the prison of control, hunger, and constant surveillance, but freedom came with its own challenges. I found temporary refuge at PJ Hostel in Groningen, a place that offered shelter but little else. Each night, in that small room, I felt both relief and unease—relief for being safe, unease because I still had no permanent place to call home. 

The weeks stretched on. Every morning, I navigated the city, applying to apartments, searching for student housing, and trying to piece together a life that had been disrupted for nearly two years. The clock ticked relentlessly toward September, the date when I could finally move into a proper student apartment at Xior Student Housing in Leeuwarden. Until then, Groningen remained a temporary holding place—a transition, a liminal space between past trauma and future possibility. 

During this period, I made the decision to return briefly to Curaçao. It wasn’t a vacation; it was a necessary step to regain perspective, reconnect with the roots that had sustained me, and prepare myself mentally for the next chapter. The return to my homeland reminded me of who I was before the abuse, before the hunger, before the months of surveillance and manipulation. I saw my family, my friends, the streets and beaches I had once walked freely, and I realized that resilience had been my constant companion all along. 

Coming back to Groningen felt different this time. I was no longer the same person who had arrived two years earlier, full of naive hope and untested independence. I was cautious, but determined. I had survived, documented, and learned lessons that no classroom could teach. And when I finally moved into my new apartment at Xior Student Housing in Leeuwarden on September 1st, the sense of permanence brought a quiet but profound relief. 

My new apartment was small, but it was mine. The keys were in my hand, and the door closed behind me not as a barrier, but as a symbol of autonomy. I could eat when I wanted, study when I needed, and live without constant interference. For the first time in years, I felt the subtle, almost forgotten sensation of control over my own life. 

Living in that space was more than physical comfort—it was a reclaiming of identity. I set routines, made my environment my own, and allowed myself to finally process the trauma I had endured. I continued to document my experiences, not as a hostage to the past, but as a guide for understanding, reflection, and healing. 

Looking back, the journey was harrowing. Each denial, each restriction, each moment of hunger or fear had left scars, both visible and invisible. But in those scars lay a story of endurance, resistance, and eventual empowerment. I learned that surviving abuse is not merely about endurance; it is about recognizing one’s own value, asserting boundaries, and taking concrete steps to reclaim agency. 

To international students, to anyone experiencing familial or household abuse, I want to say this: Your story matters. Your experiences, however isolating, are real and valid. Document, seek help, and protect your autonomy whenever possible. Even in the darkest periods, there is a path forward, and reclaiming your life is possible. 

As I settled into my new apartment, a place that reflected my independence and future aspirations, I felt a deep sense of quiet triumph. I had been knocked down repeatedly, but each time, I rose again, carrying lessons, memories, and a resilience that could not be taken. The Netherlands, which had once been a place of confinement and control, had now become a canvas for the life I wanted to build. 

And so, with my keys in hand, my documentation secure, and my mind clear for the first time in years, I began truly living. I had survived, yes—but more importantly, I had taken back my life. `,

  chapter10: {
    story: `Writing this book has been one of the most difficult and important experiences of my life. Looking back on the months I spent enduring abuse, isolation, and manipulation, I am reminded of both the fragility and the strength of the human spirit. Trauma leaves scars, but it also teaches lessons that no classroom, no textbook, and no ordinary experience ever could. 

This story is not just about suffering—it is about survival, resilience, and the quiet ways we reclaim our agency. It is a record of the challenges faced by international students, by those living away from home, and by anyone navigating abusive environments. I hope it sheds light on the reality of these experiences, and offers validation to anyone who has felt trapped, unheard, or invisible. 

I want readers to know that help exists, even if it sometimes feels distant or slow to arrive. Document your experiences. Speak your truth when you can. Seek support from people and organizations that respect your autonomy. And above all, remember that your story matters—your voice matters—even in moments when the world seems indifferent. 

Returning to Curaçao, moving into a student apartment in Leeuwarden, and finally reclaiming control over my life have all been steps toward healing. I do not claim that the scars are gone, nor that the memories are easy, but I have learned that survival is not the end of the story. Growth, autonomy, and self-respect are possible, even after the most harrowing experiences. 

If there is one message I hope readers take away, it is this: you are not alone, and you are not defined by the abuse you endure. Your life, your choices, and your future are yours to claim. 

To anyone reading this who is struggling, take one small step today. Document. Speak. Seek help. Protect your mind, your body, and your spirit. The path may be difficult, but it is possible to reclaim your life—and to live it fully. 

This book is my truth, and I share it in the hope that it may help others find courage, clarity, and freedom in their own lives. 

—Daniel van Patten `,
